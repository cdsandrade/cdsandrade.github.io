    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Chris!</p>
    <p>I am an engineer from Boston, MA with about 5 years experience, with skills spread between Linux system administration, Node developement, CI/CD pipeline implementation, and cloud operations and support. Since I like to learn and experience new technologies I am a jack-of-all-trades, but my interest and passion is mainly in using automation to empower teams to worry less about toil and more time releasing new features.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I also learn other (human) languages. :)</p>
